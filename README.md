# 100 Days of Python

This repository contains my solutions and projects as I work through the 100 Days of Python coding challenge. I'm learning core Python concepts and practicing by building small projects each day.

## Progress

**FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS:**
- **Day 1:** Band Name Generator – asked user for city and pet name.  
- **Day 2:** Tip Calculator – combined user inputs and printed a calculated bill.  
- **Day 3:** Treasure Island – text adventure game with nested conditionals.  
- **Day 4:** Rock, Paper, Scissors – used lists and random choice.  
- **Day 5:** Loops – highest score and Gauss sum.  
- **Day 6:** Functions – wrote reusable functions like even/odd and square calculator.  
- **Day 7:** Hangman – implemented a word guessing game.  
- **Day 8:** Number Guessing Game – learned how to loop until correct guess.  
- **Day 9:** Student Grade Tracker – practiced tuples, lists, and dictionaries.
- **Day 10:** Secure Login System – implemented login/registration with exception handling, user input validation, and account lock after failed attempts.
- **Day 11:** File Operations – practiced reading, writing, appending, and manipulating files using Python’s built-in I/O and os module.
- **Day 12:** String Functions – practiced string methods like .isalpha(), .isdigit(), .isalnum(), .strip(), and slicing.

**INTERMMEDIATE CONCEPTS:**
- **Day 13:** Classes & Objects – built a Bank Account simulator to understand constructors (__init__), attributes, methods, and modifying object state using self.
- **Day 14:** Inheritance & Vectors - practiced parent and child classes using Animal and Person/Worker examples. Reused parent attributes and methods, overrode methods (__str__), and used super() to access parent constructors.
  - **Operator Overloading & Vectors:** Built a custom Vector class supporting addition (+) and subtraction (-) using __add__ and __sub__. Learned to represent vectors in code and output them in a readable format.
  - **Day 15:** Multithreading – Learned about threads and how they allow Python programs to run multiple tasks simultaneously for I/O-bound operations like file downloads or web requests. Built a Multi-Threaded File Downloader that downloads files from Pinterest concurrently, handling URLs safely and naming files based on the last numbers in the URL.

# 100 Days of Python

This repository contains my solutions and projects as I work through the 100 Days of Python coding challenge. I'm learning core Python concepts and practicing by building small projects each day.

## Progress
- **Day 1:** Band Name Generator – asked user for city and pet name.  
- **Day 2:** Tip Calculator – combined user inputs and printed a calculated bill.  
- **Day 3:** Treasure Island – text adventure game with nested conditionals.  
- **Day 4:** Rock, Paper, Scissors – used lists and random choice.  
- **Day 5:** Loops – highest score and Gauss sum.  
- **Day 6:** Functions – wrote reusable functions like even/odd and square calculator.  
- **Day 7:** Hangman – implemented a word guessing game.  
- **Day 8:** Number Guessing Game – learned how to loop until correct guess.  
- **Day 9:** Student Grade Tracker – practiced tuples, lists, and dictionaries.
- **Day 10:** Secure Login System – implemented login/registration with exception handling, user input validation, and account lock after failed attempts.

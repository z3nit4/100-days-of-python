# TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word. Then print it.

# TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

# TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word. Print "Right" if it
#  is, "Wrong" if it's not.
